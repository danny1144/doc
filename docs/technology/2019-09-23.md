## es常用搜索

## 快速检查集群的健康状况

```
GET /_cat/health?v
```

说明：如何快速了解集群的健康状况？green、yellow、red？
green：每个索引的primary shard和replica shard都是active状态的
yellow：每个索引的primary shard都是active状态的，但是部分replica shard不是active状态，处于不可用的状态
red：不是所有索引的primary shard都是active状态的，部分索引有数据丢失了

## 快速查看集群中有哪些索引

```
GET /_cat/indices?v
```

 普通搜索-单索引

``` Get /logstash-2019.09.23/_search?q=kubernetes.pod_name:ofm-user ```

多索引

``` Get /logstash-2019.09.23,logstash-2019.09.22/_search?q=kubernetes.pod_name:ofm-user ```

所有索引

``` Get /all/_search?q=kubernetes.pod_name:ofm-user ```



## The parameters allowed in the URI are:

| Name                           | Description                                                  |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `q`                            | The query string (maps to the `query_string` query, see [*Query String Query*](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.6/query-dsl-query-string-query.html) for more details). |
| `df`                           | The default field to use when no field prefix is defined within the query. |
| `analyzer`                     | The analyzer name to be used when analyzing the query string. |
| `analyze_wildcard`             | Should wildcard and prefix queries be analyzed or not. Defaults to `false`. |
| `batched_reduce_size`          | The number of shard results that should be reduced at once on the coordinating node. This value should be used as a protection mechanism to reduce the memory overhead per search request if the potential number of shards in the request can be large. |
| `default_operator`             | The default operator to be used, can be `AND` or `OR`. Defaults to `OR`. |
| `lenient`                      | If set to true will cause format based failures (like providing text to a numeric field) to be ignored. Defaults to false. |
| `explain`                      | For each hit, contain an explanation of how scoring of the hits was computed. |
| `_source`                      | Set to `false` to disable retrieval of the `_source` field. You can also retrieve part of the document by using `_source_includes` & `_source_excludes` (see the [request body](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.6/search-request-source-filtering.html) documentation for more details) |
| `stored_fields`                | The selective stored fields of the document to return for each hit, comma delimited. Not specifying any value will cause no fields to return. |
| `sort`                         | Sorting to perform. Can either be in the form of `fieldName`, or `fieldName:asc`/`fieldName:desc`. The fieldName can either be an actual field within the document, or the special `_score` name to indicate sorting based on scores. There can be several `sort` parameters (order is important). |
| `track_scores`                 | When sorting, set to `true` in order to still track scores and return them as part of each hit. |
| `track_total_hits`             | Set to `false` in order to disable the tracking of the total number of hits that match the query. (see [*Index Sorting*](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.6/index-modules-index-sorting.html) for more details). Defaults to true. |
| `timeout`                      | A search timeout, bounding the search request to be executed within the specified time value and bail with the hits accumulated up to that point when expired. Defaults to no timeout. |
| `terminate_after`              | The maximum number of documents to collect for each shard, upon reaching which the query execution will terminate early. If set, the response will have a boolean field `terminated_early` to indicate whether the query execution has actually terminated_early. Defaults to no terminate_after. |
| `from`                         | The starting from index of the hits to return. Defaults to `0`. |
| `size`                         | The number of hits to return. Defaults to `10`.              |
| `search_type`                  | The type of the search operation to perform. Can be `dfs_query_then_fetch` or `query_then_fetch`. Defaults to `query_then_fetch`. See [*Search Type*](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.6/search-request-search-type.html) for more details on the different types of search that can be performed. |
| `allow_partial_search_results` | Set to `false` to return an overall failure if the request would produce partial results. Defaults to true, which will allow partial results in the case of timeouts or partial failures. This default can be controlled using the cluster-level setting `search.default_allow_partial_results`. |

## request body search

```{
GET /logstash-2019.09.23/_search
{
  "query": {
    "term": {
      "kubernetes.container_name": "sso"
    }
  }
}

```

## params

| `timeout`                      | A search timeout, bounding the search request to be executed within the specified time value and bail with the hits accumulated up to that point when expired. Search requests are canceled after the timeout is reached using the [Search Cancellation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.6/search.html#global-search-cancellation) mechanism. Defaults to no timeout. See [Time units](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.6/common-options.html#time-units). |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `from`                         | To retrieve hits from a certain offset. Defaults to `0`.     |
| `size`                         | The number of hits to return. Defaults to `10`. If you do not care about getting some hits back but only about the number of matches and/or aggregations, setting the value to `0` will help performance. |
| `search_type`                  | The type of the search operation to perform. Can be `dfs_query_then_fetch` or `query_then_fetch`. Defaults to `query_then_fetch`. See [*Search Type*](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.6/search-request-search-type.html) for more. |
| `request_cache`                | Set to `true` or `false` to enable or disable the caching of search results for requests where `size` is 0, ie aggregations and suggestions (no top hits returned). See [Shard request cache](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.6/shard-request-cache.html). |
| `allow_partial_search_results` | Set to `false` to return an overall failure if the request would produce partial results. Defaults to true, which will allow partial results in the case of timeouts or partial failures. This default can be controlled using the cluster-level setting `search.default_allow_partial_results`. |
| `terminate_after`              | The maximum number of documents to collect for each shard, upon reaching which the query execution will terminate early. If set, the response will have a boolean field `terminated_early` to indicate whether the query execution has actually terminated_early. Defaults to no terminate_after. |
| `batched_reduce_size`          | The number of shard results that should be reduced at once on the coordinating node. This value should be used as a protection mechanism to reduce the memory overhead per search request if the potential number of shards in the request can be large. |

## 快速查询匹配的文档

```
GET /_search?q=kubernetes.container_name:sso&size=0&terminate_after=1
```

说一句吧，ES5.0 大改版之后
index.query.bool.max_clause_count: 1024
已经是不可用了，重启后是无法打开ES的，取而代之的是
indices.query.bool.max_clause_count: 1024

### from /size分页

```console
GET /_search
{
    "from" : 0, "size" : 10,
    "query" : {
        "term" : { "kubernetes.container_name": "sso"}
    }
}
```

```GET /logstash-2019.09.23/_search
两个属性满足同一个条件
{
  "query": {
    "multi_match": {
      "query": "sso",
      "fields": ["kubernetes.container_name", "kubernetes.pod_name"]
    }
  }
} 
```

## 范围查询

```GET /ecommerce/product/_search 
GET /ecommerce/product/_search 
{
  "query": {
    "range": {
      "price": {
        "gte": 30
      }
    }
  }
}

```

## 根据条件删除文档

```
POST /myindex/book/_delete_by_query
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "name": "c++"
    }
  }
}
```

## 删除索引

  "sort": [
    {
      "_id": {
        "order": "desc"
      }
    } 
  ] 
}
```

### Sort mode option
